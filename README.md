# Intelligent-Waste-Segregation-System-Using-Computer-Vision-and-IoT
An Intelligent waste segregation bin that uses computer vision and IoT to automatically classify waste as dry or wet. It detects waste with an IR sensor, captures images via ESP32-CAM, classifies them as dry or wet using a YOLO model on a server, and controls a servo in real time for automatic segregation.
