Motivation:- Every day, recyclable and biodegradable waste end up mixed together, not because people don’t care, but because segregation is inconvenient and often ignored. Improper waste segregation leads to inefficient recycling, environmental pollution, and increased health risks. This project is motivated by the need for a simple, low-cost, and automated solution that reduces human effort and errors in waste sorting. By combining computer vision and IoT, the system aims to promote better waste management practices and contribute to cleaner and smarter communities.

Implementation:- he system employs an IR sensor monitored by an Arduino to detect the presence of waste. Upon detection, the Arduino signals an ESP32-CAM module to capture an image of the waste and transmit it to a web server over Wi-Fi. A Python-based application running on the server retrieves the image and processes it using a YOLOv11 deep learning model trained for dry–wet waste classification. For project analysis and documentation, the captured images are also saved. Based on the classification result, the server sends a response back to the ESP32-CAM, which forwards the decision to the Arduino. The Arduino then controls a servo mechanism to physically direct the waste into the appropriate compartment.
